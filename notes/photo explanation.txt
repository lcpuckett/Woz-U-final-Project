VA1- shows ages grouped along the top and each bar is prior convictions for property along the bottom (0-3+).
looking at "within 3 years" on the left in True and false blocks and prior convictions for violence are the height of the bar.
education is in color, red is less than HS, orange is HS and blue is some college.
**this chart has a lot of info to tak in BUT it also tells us a lot! young people dont have many prior convictions but are 
going back to jail within three years. where we see older people having many more prior convictions but not quite going back within 3 years.

VA2- shows true on the left in orange for if someone was arrested within three year. this shows level of a positive drug test for each drug listed. 
levels are individually small numbers, the code said it was the number from the drug test about how much drug was in their system, 
the results are cumulative and could be a bit misleading because few people can have lots of THC in their system and many could have low levels of meth, etc
but still an interesting find! what I found as i looked more was that THC was always the largest but otherwise things were pretty even, prior convictions evened out, etc.

VA3- looking at ethnicity and gender breakdown, more men very obviously. more black men than white men, but interestingly more white women than black women, almost double. 

VA4- Im quite proud of this one! for the pretty colors alone. On the left we have total crime added up for each month of each year. alone the bottom are the months. 
the bar colors are years and the width of the bar is the percentage of unemployment in Georgia. It is vert easy to see the bars get skinnier as they go down in total crime. 
This means that unemployment was going down from 2013 to 2015, and so was crime!
