I felt our project might get lost in the creep because there is so much data to analyze. I even find myself forgetting parts or the foundation of what we are looking at.
so to help with that, I made this! I asked our first question again and put some answers with the "how" that we will find in our data. Mostly for me, but I hope its useful nonetheless.


Why do people return to jail? (we have return data for 1,2,3 and within 3 years)

Is it the type of offense? (prison offense VS recid)
does recurring offenses give us a clue? (each convictions VS all 4 recid& compare)
does a certian age make a difference? (age VS recid)
Does having low education mean anything? (education vs. recid)
does gender or race mean anything? (G/R vs recid)
Is unemployment a factor? (crime VS unemployment)
Does drug use play a role? (convictions on drugs single out for all 4 recid) 
[or maybe even look at arrests for this one, goes 0 to 5 or more, which may have better correlation findings]
--
What can we do about all of this?
-Look at trends in age vs. type of crime.
-look at trends in average unemployment each year vs crime
make statements to fixing these issues by... programs? need some good outside social info.



Presentation Ideas:
Title: Returning to jail, more than the crime

-priors
-education
-race gender?
-unemployment
-drugs

we are doing jail data. we personally feel this is important, have been affected by the prison system (family and friends) 
and someone that used to work in prisons shared that men under 25 have better chance of not returning but past that they are
 stuck in and out of jail for life


do normal bar for prison offense, age at release, education, within three years 
(so we built an idea about the type of person returning to jail)

significant positive correlation with crime and unemployment

being arrested within three years is highly correlated with being arrested again within that first year. 
less correlated as year increases. so we see that our assumed people will get arrested again within a year 
(does the young people thing track right? yes, because from 30 to older goes up again, assuming older people getting out of jail will go right back.)
data:  x and y
