I felt our project might get lost in the creep because there is so much data to analyze. I even find myself forgetting parts or the foundation of what we are looking at.
so to help with that, I made this! I asked our first question again and put some answers with the "how" that we will find in our data. Mostly for me, but I hope its useful nonetheless.


Why do people return to jail? (we have return data for 1,2,3 and within 3 years)

Is it the type of offense? (prison offense VS recid)
does recurring offenses give us a clue? (each convictions VS all 4 recid& compare)
does a certian age make a difference? (age VS recid)
Does having low education mean anything? (education vs. recid)
does gender or race mean anything? (G/R vs recid)
Is unemployment a factor? (crime VS unemployment)
Does drug use play a role? (convictions on drugs single out for all 4 recid) 
[or maybe even look at arrests for this one, goes 0 to 5 or more, which may have better correlation findings]
--
What can we do about all of this?
-Look at trends in age vs. type of crime.
-look at trends in average unemployment each year vs crime
make statements to fixing these issues by... programs? need some good outside social info.
